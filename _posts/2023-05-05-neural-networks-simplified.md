# Neural Networks Simplified

Okay, letâ€™s directly get to the point without any bs. 

What exactly is a neural network?

A. A neural network is a type of machine-learning algorithm inspired by the structure of the human brain. It consists of interconnected processing nodes, called neurons, that work together to process and analyze complex data. Neural networks can learn from examples and can be trained to recognize patterns in data, making them useful for a variety of tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling. They are widely used in artificial intelligence applications and are a fundamental building block for many modern technologies.

Weâ€™ll sound pretty complicated, right? Letâ€™s break it down.

A neural network is nothing but a program that is designed to work in a way just like a human brain. Just like our brain has tiny cells called neurons that help us to think and learn, a neural network is made up of tiny parts that work together to solve a particular problem.

Still didnâ€™t understand?

Okay, let me give you a real example. We use Facebook right, when we upload a picture onto Facebook, it automatically suggests the people in the image or your friends to tag them. The model recognizes the images and produces an output of who the person in the picture is.

The neural network analyzes the photo and recognizes specific patterns, such as the shape of a person's face or the color of their hair. It then matches those patterns to a database of previously tagged images to identify who is in the photo. 

You ask why a neural network when we could manually tag ourselves, but what if there are thousands of faces in a single image? Thatâ€™s where we need it for large datasets.

Why do we use neural networks, weâ€™ll the neural network takes in an input **X**, perform a mathematical operation, and produces an output **Y** with a function of **f**

So Iâ€™m not going deep into the application or the procedure in this post, as Iâ€™ve just started to learn NN from this course [NeuralNetworks](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) ðŸ™‚ðŸ˜…

This is probably the best course Iâ€™ve found on the web.

Iâ€™ll keep posting the content as I learn. Good day :)
